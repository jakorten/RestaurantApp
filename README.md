# RestaurantApp
The Everyone Can Code course for Swift has a "guided project" called Restaurant. One needs a server app to get JSON. There are problems with the original app and also with the Python work-around (both technical and didactical). We have recreated the app for your students to use. The initials commits are not yet fully functional but we will make sure they are (planning: end of April 2018). Feel free to add comments / etc.
